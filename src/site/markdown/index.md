# Introduction to GINA

Gina provides a support for the graphical user interface layer. 
  
Even if this framework is agnostic from any technologies a Swing implementation has been developped. 
  
Gina's GUIs are reactives and can be plugged onto various technological space. This is made possible thanks to bindings provided by a [Connie library](https://openflexo.org/connie/)
  
Gina's GUIs are editable at runtime. Behind GUI's are stored in an XML like format called FIB.
